##The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a web-based application that allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously — just like Google Docs.
This editor was built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Socket.IO for the backend, 
enabling real-time communication and document synchronization between users.
Changes made by one user appear instantly for all others connected to the same document.
